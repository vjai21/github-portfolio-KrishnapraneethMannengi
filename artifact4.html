          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
           For my fourth artifact, I selected a recent assignment that demonstrates my growing proficiency in artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts. This artifact was chosen because it highlights a different dimension of my capabilities—specifically, my ability to analyze real-world AI/ML applications, articulate key technical principles, and translate complex topics into clear insights for both technical and non-technical audiences. By revising and expanding the original submission, I ensured that the artifact aligns with the expectations of a professional portfolio and conveys the depth of my understanding.

In preparing this artifact for my portfolio, I focused on refining the structure, improving clarity, and incorporating additional context so that viewers can easily understand the significance of the work. The revision includes clearer explanations of the underlying AI/ML methods used, as well as more detailed commentary on how these methods contribute to solving real-world challenges. This adaptation ensures that potential employers, instructors, or industry professionals can quickly grasp the value of the work and the skills it reflects.

This artifact not only demonstrates technical knowledge, but also the ability to evaluate AI/ML solutions critically—an essential skill for applying machine learning responsibly and effectively. It reflects my competency in problem-solving, model interpretation, data analysis, and communication. Including this in my portfolio broadens the scope of my showcased strengths and reinforces my readiness to contribute meaningfully in professional AI/ML environments.

With this fourth artifact added, my portfolio now presents a well-rounded view of my development, covering implementation, analysis, communication, and strategic thinking in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
