          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Machine Learning Fundamental </strong> course highlights my learning experience and growth while completing the Machine Learning Fundamentals artifact. Through this project, I explored essential ML concepts such as data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics, and result interpretation. The reflection explains what I learned, the feedback I applied, and how this artifact represents an important step in developing my skills as a future AI and machine learning professional.
          </p>

          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The objective of this artifact was to apply foundational Machine Learning concepts to a real dataset by completing the full model development workflow. This included loading and preparing the data, performing exploratory data analysis, selecting appropriate algorithms, training and evaluating models, and interpreting performance results using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. The purpose was to demonstrate my understanding of how machine learning models are built, validated, and improved in practical applications.
          </p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Reviewed course requirements and identified which Machine Learning Fundamentals artifacts needed to be showcased.</li>
            <li>Planned the portfolio structure, including sections such as About Me, Projects, Skills, Artifacts, and Contact.</li>
            <li>Created a GitHub repository and enabled GitHub Pages to host the website.</li>
            <li>Designed the portfolio layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a clean and responsive interface.</li>
            <li>Wrote clear descriptions for each artifact, including objectives, tools used, process, value proposition, and evidence.</li>
            <li>Tested the portfolio on desktop and mobile devices to ensure full responsiveness and accessibility.</li>
            <li>Published the final version on GitHub Pages and confirmed that all links, visuals, and artifacts displayed correctly.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>IDE: Visual Studio</li>
            <li>Repository: GIT</li>
            <li>Hosting: GitHub Pages</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
          <p>
            This artifact provides strong evidence of my ability to understand and apply core Machine Learning principles in real-world scenarios. It demonstrates my capability to:<ul>
<li>Clean and prepare structured data for analysis</li>

<li>Build ML models from scratch using industry-standard tools</li>

<li>Evaluate models using meaningful metrics, not just accuracy</li>

<li>Interpret confusion matrices and classification reports</li>

<li>Apply critical thinking to explain algorithm choices</li>

<li>Present results in a clear and visual format</li>
</ul>This artifact shows potential employers and academic reviewers that I can work with real datasets, make data-driven decisions, and build predictive models aligned with business or research goals. It highlights my growth as a developing Machine Learning practitioner and establishes a foundation for more advanced work in AI.
